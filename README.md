# Project Overview

This project was made to share my take on how a Java project can be structured in a way that allows for explaining and showcasing core and complex concepts such as:

- **S.O.L.I.D Principles**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
- **Docker**
- **Plugins like PlantUML, UML, OpenAPI**, and more.

## Business Value

The primary business value of this project is to provide a **sandbox for creating games with custom rules** in a scalable and testable manner. This is achieved through a well-defined breakdown of the logic layers.

## Development Approach

Throughout the development process, each commit explains in detail the progress made. The commits follow an unrealistic sequential order, as the initial purpose of this project was to document a formula for building a working canvas. The goal is to later transition into an understandable, reasonably simple, and easy-to-read MVP.

## First Game: Rock Paper Scissors

The first game included is **Rock Paper Scissors**. However, readers will quickly realize how the project can easily be adapted to include other games, such as:

- Naval Battle
- Chess
- And more...

## Conclusion

This project serves as a flexible framework for expanding into various types of games, all while maintaining a focus on scalable architecture, testability, and adherence to key software design principles.
